# Fintrack-project
FinTrack Pro is a command-line based personal finance management system developed using Python, SQLite, and SQLAlchemy ORM.
This project helps users efficiently manage their daily expenses, categories, monthly budgets, and spending analytics through a simple and interactive CLI interface.

The system allows users to add, update, delete, and search expenses, organize them using categories, set monthly budget limits, and receive alerts when expenses exceed the budget. It also provides category-wise spending analysis using SQL queries.

This project demonstrates the practical implementation of Object Relational Mapping (ORM), database relationships, CRUD operations, and real-world finance tracking logic.
